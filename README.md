- 👋 Hi, I am Abimbola, a passionate data analyst with an educational background in International Business and Civil Engineering. I have years of experience in the education sector, where I was involved in teaching and coaching. My desire to share information with others has fuelled much of my career.
I ventured into entrepreneurship, establishing a start-up in the bag manufacturing industry a few years ago. Although the business is temporarily closed because of academic pursuits,the experience taught me lots in business strategy, operations, and the challenges of running a small enterprise.
- 👀 I am interested in how data can impact business decisions,leveraging technology to enhance education, as well as the acceleration of growth and expansion for start-ups.
- 🌱 I am currently on a virtual intership program with JP Morgan Chase and Co., an avenue for continuous expansion of knowledge in my field.
- 💞️ I am eager to connect with entrepreneurs, business and data analysts, educators and other like-minded professionals.
